# Go for System Administration 

## Abstract

This exciting presentation will be packed with live demos on getting things done with Go. We'll start with a light introduction to Go and preparing a local Go development environment. Next we'll take a tour of the Go standard library with a focus on the Go packages most useful for modern day system administration and automation -- with stops along the way for demos and code reviews of real world Go applications. Finally we'll wrap up with tips on building and distributing Go programs.

### Topics

 * Getting Setup
 * Building CLI Utilities
 * Cloud Automation - Managing Openstack instances
 * Gathering Metrics - Pushing GitHub metrics to Graphite 
 * Distributing Go Programs

#### Getting Setup
Walkthrough installing Go, setting up the GOPATH, and configuring the Vim text editor.

#### Building CLI Utilities
Live coding of a CLI utility using the [flag][1] and [os][2] packages from the Go standard library.

#### Cloud Automation
Code review and demo a Go application used to manage Openstack instances. Explain the usage of the [net/http][3] and [encoding/json][4] packages from the Go standard library.

#### Gathering Metrics
Code review and demo a Go application that gathers metrics from GitHub and pushes those metrics to Graphite over TCP/IP. Explain the usage of the [net][5] package from the Go standard library, and how to make practical use of [goroutines][6] and [channels][7].

#### Distributing Go Programs
Walkthrough of building and distributing Go programs. Discuss the benefits and pitfalls of Go's single binaries.
