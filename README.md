# Go for Sysadmins

## Description

As a Sysadmin, why should you learn more about Go?  Well, imagine not having to mess around with old versions of Python or Ruby(I’m looking at you RHEL 5), or fall back to C when you need to improve performance.  Imagine being able to deploy self-contained binaires that don’t require yet another runtime to be installed on the target system. If that sounds awesome to you, then you’re going to love Go.

Using packages found in the standard library and Go’s unique language features, I’ll show you how to solve common Sysadmin problems in new ways, and set the stage for tackling a whole new set of problems that our current tools have made way too complicated.

Attend Go for Sysadmins and learn how to:

* Leverage the Go standard library for everyday system administration tasks.
* Make practical use of goroutines and channels in system utilities and scripts
* Follow best practices for managing, building, and distributing Go projects.

## Notes for the Planning Committee

What makes this session great is that as a Sysadmin, I’ll add diversity to the conference by talking about Go from a different angle. I (and other admins) have grown tired of fighting with the system Ruby/Python, and managing library dependencies with pip and bundler. I just want to focus on getting things done. And Go makes that a reality for me.

Most talks about Go are geared towards developers, but there’s a lot of things for Sysadmins to be excited about.  While concurrency and language semantics are great, we sysadmins are more concerned with writing simple code that solves the problem. 

As the founder of the [South East Puppet Users Group][1] and former co-organizer of the [PyAtl Users Group][2], I’ve given many talks ranging from System Administration to Software development. Right before landing a job at my current employer Puppet Labs, I gave a talk at PuppetConf 2011- [Streamlining Workflow with Puppet][3].



Since then I’ve given quite a few talks and webinars on using Puppet technologies:

* [Streamlining Workflow with Puppet][4] (PuppetConf 2011)
* [External Data: Hiera, ENC's][5] (PuppetConf 2012)
* [Network Automation Puppet and Juniper Networks][6]
* About 6 Puppet Camps -- sorry no videos
